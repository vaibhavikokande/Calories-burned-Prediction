🔥 Calories Burned Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the number of calories burned during physical activities based on user attributes and workout parameters such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and visualization to model building and evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can estimate how many calories a person burns during exercise. This can help in:

Fitness tracking

Personalized workout planning

Health monitoring

Calorie management

The model learns patterns from historical exercise data and predicts calorie burn for new inputs.
